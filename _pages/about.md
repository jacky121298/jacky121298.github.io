Hello! I'm Tsung-Lin. I received my M.S. degree in [Computer Science and Information Engineering](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw//?locale=en) from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english), where I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Winston H. Hsu](https://winstonhsu.info). Currently, I'm working on <b>3D Perception</b>, <b>Domain Adaptation</b>, and <b>Weakly-supervised 3D Object Detection</b>.
