Hello! I'm Tsung-Lin Tsou. I received my M.S. degree in [Computer Science and Information Engineering](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw//?locale=en) from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english), where I'm fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Winston H. Hsu](https://winstonhsu.info). My research primarily focused on <b>3D Perception</b>, <b>Domain Adaptation</b>, and <b>Weakly-supervised 3D Object Detection</b>.

Prior to my M.S. degree, I also earned my B.S. degree in [Computer Science and Information Engineering](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw//?locale=en) from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english). My undergraduate research focused on <b>3D Auto Labeling</b> with Prof. [Winston H. Hsu](https://winstonhsu.info) and <b>Intersection Management</b> with Prof. [Chung-Wei Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cwlin/). Additionally, I completed an internship with the [MediaTek](https://www.mediatek.com) Video Coding & Processing Team, where I designed convolutional neural networks to serve as loop filters in <b>Video Coding</b> and applied the <b>Knowledge Distillation</b> technique to reduce cost.
