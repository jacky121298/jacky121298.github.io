    abstract={We propose a Colored Timed Petri Net (CTPN) based model for intersection management. With the expressiveness of the CTPN-based model, we can consider timing, vehicle-specific information, and different types of vehicles. We then design deadlock-free policies and guarantee deadlock-freeness for intersection management. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on CTPN-based deadlock analysis and prevention for intersection management.},

    abstract={Dense depth estimation plays a key role in multiple applications such as robotics, 3D reconstruction, and augmented reality. While sparse signal, e.g., LiDAR and Radar, has been leveraged as guidance for enhancing dense depth estimation, the improvement is limited due to its low density and imbalanced distribution. To maximize the utility from the sparse source, we propose S3 technique, which expands the depth value from sparse cues while estimating the confidence of expanded region. The proposed S3 can be applied to various guided depth estimation approaches and trained end-to-end at different stages, including input, cost volume and output. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and flexibility of the S3 technique on LiDAR and Radar signal.},
